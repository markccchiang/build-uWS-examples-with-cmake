# Build uWebSockets examples with CMake
Please read `CMakeLists.txt` first, modify it, or install libraries if needed. And then build examples with commands:
```
chmod +x src/check_folders.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
The uWebSockets source codes are from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets).
